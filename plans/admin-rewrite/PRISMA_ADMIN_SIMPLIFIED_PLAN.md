## Status: 95% Complete

### ✅ Done (Weeks 1-6)

- Built all core components (data table, forms, JSON editor)
- Implemented all server actions with direct Prisma
- Created fully-featured admin in examples/admin-nextjs15

- Rich text editor, file upload, array fields
- One-to-many and many-to-many relations
- CSV import/export functionality
- Settings UI with drag-drop field ordering
- Custom renderer system for extensibility

### ✅ Completed Testing & Features
- Real-world testing completed
- All field types implemented
- Relations fully working
- Import/export functional

### ❌ Remaining Tasks (Week 7-8)
- Extract tested components to @paljs/admin package
- Create CLI for easy installation
- Write migration guide
- Add i18n support
- Performance optimizations (streaming, virtual scrolling)

## Core Philosophy
- **Simple, clean, professional code**
- **No complex abstractions**
- **Direct Prisma access with Server Components**
- **Build in example app first, extract to package later**
- **Focus on JSON field support**

## Development Location
Work directly in `examples/admin-nextjs15/` to ensure real-world testing before packaging.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Simple Components
- No complex hooks or abstractions
- Each component does one thing well
- Clear prop interfaces
- Direct server actions

### 2. Folder Structure
```
src/
├── app/
│   └── admin/
│       ├── [model]/
│       │   ├── page.tsx          # List view
│       │   ├── [id]/
│       │   │   └── page.tsx      # Edit view
│       │   └── new/
│       │       └── page.tsx      # Create view
│       └── _components/
│           ├── data-table.tsx
│           ├── form-field.tsx
│           ├── json-editor.tsx
│           └── relation-field.tsx
├── lib/
│   ├── prisma.ts                # Singleton client
│   └── actions/
│       └── [model].ts           # CRUD server actions
└── utils/
    └── prisma-helpers.ts        # Schema introspection
```

### 4. Implementation Steps

1. **Remove Old Admin** (Week 1) ✅ **DONE**
   - ✅ Clean out GraphQL dependencies
   - ✅ Remove Apollo and old admin components
   - ✅ Keep shadcn/ui components

2. **Build Core Components** (Week 2-3) ✅ **DONE**
   - ✅ Simple data table
   - ✅ Form components
   - ✅ JSON editor

3. **Add Server Actions** (Week 3-4) ✅ **DONE**
   - ✅ CRUD operations
   - ✅ Direct Prisma queries
   - ✅ No GraphQL layer

4. **Test & Refine** (Week 5-6) ✅ **DONE**
   - ✅ Real-world testing
   - ✅ Added all missing features
   - ✅ Comprehensive functionality

5. **Extract to Package** (Week 7-8) ❌ **TODO**
   - ❌ Move tested components to package
   - ❌ Create simple CLI tool
   - ❌ Write migration guide

## What We Actually Built Beyond Plans
- ✅ Custom renderer system (not a complex plugin system, but extensible)
- ✅ Advanced filtering beyond "basic"
- ✅ Bulk operations
- ✅ Rich field types (file upload, rich text)
- ✅ Full relation management
- ✅ Import/export capabilities

## What We're Still NOT Building
- ❌ GraphQL support (removed as planned)
- ❌ Analytics/charts
- ❌ AI features
- ❌ Real-time updates
- ❌ History/audit logs

## Success Criteria ✅ ACHIEVED
- ✅ Clean, readable code with no `any` types
- ✅ Fast performance with server components
- ✅ Excellent JSON field support with Monaco editor
- ✅ Easy to understand and modify
- ✅ Works perfectly in the example app
- ✅ Feature parity with old admin (and more)
- ✅ Modern React patterns (Server Components, Server Actions)
